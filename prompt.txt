I developed an interactive rotating spring simulator that models a mass attached to a spring while rotating about a fixed pivot. Users can adjust angular speed, spring constant, rest length, mass, and simulation speed, then watch the system evolve on a canvas with optional stats and a terminal-speed view. The visualization shows how the spring stretches under rotation and how the mass settles toward a dynamic equilibrium where centrifugal effects balance spring force, giving an intuitive feel for Hooke’s law in a rotating frame.  

One of the biggest challenges I faced was figuring out the governing equations and implementing them correctly. Getting the balance between spring extension and centripetal requirements right—captured by relationships like m·r·ω² ≈ k·(r − L₀)—was sensitive to small mistakes, and even minor sign or frame-of-reference errors created unstable or non-physical motion. I also had to be careful with discrete time-stepping so that numerical integration didn’t inject energy or overdamp the system, and to keep the rendered motion synchronized with changing parameters in real time. 

There’s still room to improve. I plan to refine the integrator for better stability at high angular speeds, add clearer labels and units to controls, and expand the stats with energy breakdowns to verify conservation and damping effects. Longer-term, I want to support transient spin-up/spin-down scenarios, add optional air drag, and offer presets that make it easier to explore key phenomena like equilibrium radius, oscillation about equilibrium, and approach to terminal speed.
